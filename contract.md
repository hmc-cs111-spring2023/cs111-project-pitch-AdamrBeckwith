## Goals

  `_At a high level, what do you most want to get out of this project, and why?_`

There are two things I want to get out of this project. 

1: I want to enjoy the process of creating it. Its very rare I get to make something TTRPG related, so this should be fun for me. I have a lot of larger projects I need to work on these coming weeks with Clinic and Machine Learning Systems. MLS's project is much less interesting to me and clinic is clinic, so having a project I can work on, be productive and be in my interest area is very good for my mental health.

2:  I want a usable system that *I* can use when I do my TTRPG odds calculations. I am a TTRPG creator, and being able to understand the probability of the systems is like the most important thing when designing systems.  So that means there may be a lot of choices I make in order to make this usuable to me. I don't know if its feasible to pull away from scala, but the shortest line to usability would be ideal. I think that bloats the scale of the project (especially making something like a gui) regardless, my own usability is a forefront. 

## Concepts / skills

`_What concepts and / or skills from class would you like to work on, as part of your
project? Are there any concepts / skills that we haven't covered in class that you would
like to work on, as part of your project (for example, other things related to DSLs that
you have come across, or topics from other classes)? Why are you interested in working on
these things?_`

## Time management plan

`_How do you plan to set aside time outside of class, to work on the project? Are there
intermediate milestones that you can create, to help you make consistent progress?_`

## Teamwork plan

`_If you plan to work with someone else on the project, what is your plan for
collaborating? What part(s) do you think you might do together? What part(s) are you
considering doing separately? How will you hold one another accountable to make regular
progress?_`

## Critique plan

`_What will you do to make sure that you can give consistent and actionable feedback to
other people in the class?_`

## Success

`_At the end of the semester, what would you be proud to show or tell someone about your
project?_`

## Assessment

`_Looking over your responses to the previous questions, what would you consider to be an
"A-" for your project? What would you consider to be an "A"?_`
