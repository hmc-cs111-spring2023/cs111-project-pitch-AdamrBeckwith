## Goals

  `_At a high level, what do you most want to get out of this project, and why?_`

There are two things I want to get out of this project. 

1: I want to enjoy the process of creating it. Its very rare I get to make something TTRPG related, so this should be fun for me. I have a lot of larger projects I need to work on these coming weeks with Clinic and Machine Learning Systems. MLS's project is much less interesting to me and clinic is clinic, so having a project I can work on, be productive and be in my interest area is very good for my mental health.

2:  I want a usable system that *I* can use when I do my TTRPG odds calculations. I am a TTRPG creator, and being able to understand the probability of the systems is like the most important thing when designing systems.  So that means there may be a lot of choices I make in order to make this usuable to me. I don't know if its feasible to pull away from scala, but the shortest line to usability would be ideal. I think that bloats the scale of the project (especially making something like a gui) regardless, my own usability is a forefront. 

## Concepts / skills

`_What concepts and / or skills from class would you like to work on, as part of your
project? Are there any concepts / skills that we haven't covered in class that you would
like to work on, as part of your project (for example, other things related to DSLs that
you have come across, or topics from other classes)? Why are you interested in working on
these things?_`

After the previous homework, I feel like my main motivation is to see what limits I can push with the setup that we have in scala. We only scratched the surface in making the internal DSL's. With the current project goals, I also think I will be exploring the alternative aswell : External DSL's. So overall the skills I would like to focus on are learning about DSL's and polishing my experience with scala design implementation. In addition, I am excited to try and design this language now that I know the limits of what I can do. Especially now that we can get feedback and work in groups. 

Alternatively I would also be interested in checking out other solutions besides scala aswell. We didnt get too much into it in class, but I am excited to check on it. I think overall a GUI would be wayyyy out of scope for this project, but a solid readme and relatively quick way to use the language is my goal. Python would be my target for an internal DSL since its the simplest one and also commonly used. 

## Time management plan

`_How do you plan to set aside time outside of class, to work on the project? Are there
intermediate milestones that you can create, to help you make consistent progress?_`

I have biweekly HW's in my other classes, so ideally, I will have large work weeks and smaller work weeks in tandem with that schedule. So that my scheudle is a little bit easier to manage. I think tuesdays and mondays will be the main days I work. Ideally I maintain a similar schedule to before break with the work being done approximately around wednesday evening. (a little later the the tuesday deadline of the past). 

Some Intermediate milestones are: 
 - Design And "User Feedback" 
      - Make the design and see how people feel about it 
 - implement basic functionality 
 - Expand basic functionality with more and more tools 

The goal is to keep the system modular and a set of *tools* rather the set of *commands*. Ie give the user the ability to Filter for the largest three values( or something else), rather then making a command `filterHighestThree`. 

## Teamwork plan

`_If you plan to work with someone else on the project, what is your plan for
collaborating? What part(s) do you think you might do together? What part(s) are you
considering doing separately? How will you hold one another accountable to make regular
progress?_`

_n/a_ 

## Critique plan

`_What will you do to make sure that you can give consistent and actionable feedback to
other people in the class?_`

I think being invested into 1 to 3 projects rather the new project each feedback would be ideal. That way I can look at the progress being made and already have the context to understand it. I think it would be fun to be involved in the design process aswell. Plus knowing a codebase makes it way easier to spot bugs and implemtation issues. 

In addition, I will focus on providing feedback to people with similar projects to mine (in terms of implementation). Like if someone else does scala external DSL it would be good for me (assuming im doing the same) to provide feedback on their projects. This means I have the sense of context and can look for places I messed up, and possibly see places for myself to improve during the feedback. 

## Success

`_At the end of the semester, what would you be proud to show or tell someone about your
project?_`

I would like to have a small gif of using the DSL. Just something clean and clear. If I have that, thats something I can show people and even without computer experience they would understand it. I will also likely add this to my personal github as a personal project I can work on into the future and put on resumes. (assuming what I make is good). 

In the end, Im not going to stress myself out with this project, as I have another one of a similar caliber and clinic all to focus on. But if I can maintain a clear goal and complete it while enjoying the process, even if it isn't extravagent, that would be something I would be proud to complete, and show others. 

## Assessment

`_Looking over your responses to the previous questions, what would you consider to be an
"A-" for your project? What would you consider to be an "A"?_`

And a for this project would be to go beyond the "Clear goal" and add more features then I initially intended. Alternatively, it could be polishing the resource to a higher standard. Such as pushing simple usability.  

I mean honestly I would love to just say that my A is completeing the project while maintaining a good work life balance. But thats just the Senior-itis talking
